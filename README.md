Welcome to Feature Engineering!
In this course you'll learn about one of the most important steps on the way to building a great machine learning model: feature engineering. You'll learn how to:

determine which features are the most important with mutual information
invent new features in several real-world problem domains
encode high-cardinality categoricals with a target encoding
create segmentation features with k-means clustering
decompose a dataset's variation into features with principal component analysis
The hands-on exercises build up to a complete notebook that applies all of these techniques to make a submission to the House Prices Getting Started competition. After completing this course, you'll have several ideas that you can use to further improve your performance.

Are you ready? Let's go!
